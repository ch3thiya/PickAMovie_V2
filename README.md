## Features

### ðŸŽ¬ For All Users:

- **Intuitive Filter Page:** The central hub of the application where users can specify their criteria to find a movie.
- **Multi-Faceted Filtering:** Users can filter movies by:
  - Genre
  - Year Range (From/To)
  - Minimum User Rating (from 4+ to 9+)
  - Language
- **Randomized Recommendation Engine:** Instead of showing a list, the app fetches a single random movie that perfectly matches the user's selected filters.

### ðŸ‘¤ For Registered Users:

- **Secure Account Management:** Full user authentication including registration, login/logout, and a secure account deletion process.
- **"Watch Later" List:** Save interesting movies to a personal "Watch Later" list.
- **"Watched" List:** Keep a history of movies you have seen by marking them as "Watched".
- **Personalized Profile Page:** A central dashboard displaying key stats (total movies watched, total on watch later) and a tabbed interface to view your saved movie lists.
- **Efficient List Management:** Easily move movies from "Watch Later" to "Watched" or delete them from your lists entirely.

### âœ¨ User Experience Enhancements:

- **Session-Based Prefetching:** The "Next Movie" button is instantaneous. The app prefetches a small "playlist" of movie IDs based on the initial search, pulling from this fast, local list until it's exhausted.
- **Auto-Dismissing Notifications:** User feedback, such as a successful account deletion, is displayed in a notification banner that automatically fades out.
- **Dynamic & Responsive UI:** The interface adapts based on authentication status and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Security Model

- **Secret Key Management:** The Django SECRET_KEY and external TMDB_API_KEY are stored as environment variables using a .env file locally and are set securely on the production server. They are never committed to version control.
- **CSRF Protection:** All forms that change state (login, signup, add/delete from lists) are protected with Django's built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery middleware and tokens.
- **Production Settings:** The application is deployed with DEBUG = False to prevent exposure of sensitive configuration data.
- **Allowed Hosts:** The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting is configured to only permit requests from the production domain, preventing HTTP Host header attacks.
- **User Data:** Password management is handled by Django's secure, built-in authentication system.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** By using Django's ORM for all database queries, the application is protected against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
